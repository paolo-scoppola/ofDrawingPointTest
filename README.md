# ofDrawingPointTest
points drawing performance test

This repository has been made for post I made in OF forum about drawing texture points in 3D space and apply the depth test.

https://forum.openframeworks.cc/t/point-as-texture-with-depth-test-enabled/38001/7

The control panel allows you to enable/disable depth test, sort points and see how this affect fps. Finally you can switch between texture points and  GL points.
